Introduction:

City Explorer is a web application that helps users find events and activities in different cities. This README file provides an overview of the application, its features, and how to use it.

Features:

    View popular upcoming events on the homepage
    Search for events by city, date, and category
    View detailed information about each event, including date, time, address, description, and user comments
    Register and login to save favorite events and post comments
    Report inappropriate events or comments

Conception:

Initially, we planned to use an API to retrieve events and activities data for each city. However, we faced difficulties finding an appropriate API that met our requirements. Thus, we decided to create our own relational database to store information on events and activities in various cities. The database includes tables for events, locations, dates, event categories, users, and comments.

Implementation:

We built the application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which consists of a data model, views, and a controller. Users can access the application through a homepage that displays popular upcoming events, and can also search for events by city, date, and category. Each event has its own dedicated page that provides detailed information, including date, time, address, description, and user comments. Users can register and log in to save their favorite events and post comments. We also integrated user registration and login features, as well as the ability to report inappropriate events or comments.

Difficulties:

The main difficulty we faced was finding an appropriate API to retrieve information on events and activities. After extensive research, we decided to create our own relational database to store information. In retrospect, we should have spent more time searching for an appropriate API before deciding to create our own database.

Originality and Effort:

City Explorer stands out for its simplicity and pragmatism. We designed a simple and intuitive user interface and integrated user registration, login, and report features. We also created our own relational database to store information on events and activities in different cities, which allowed us to customize the application to our specific needs.


In conclusion, City Explorer is a simple and pragmatic web application that helps users find events and activities in different cities. Despite facing difficulties with using an API to retrieve information, we were able to create our own relational database to store user data and contact requests. We hope that this application will be useful for users looking to explore different cities and their events.
